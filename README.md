# scorpius

Scorpius is a framework for defining and executing trigger in Java. Trigger is a type of event-driven programming, which you define an independent handler and register it with an event. When that event is fired, the associated trigger will be executed. A trigger can have an optional condition, to specify whether the trigger should be executed for a specific event payload.
